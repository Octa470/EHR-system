# Electronic Health Record System

This is an Electronice Health Record (EHR) system made for Sanskritee Shilpa Pandey for her college project. The code is made in such a way that is does not look too unrealistic and fits in with the original project requirements.

## Contents

- `frontend` contains all the files related to and responsible for the working of the frontend of the site.
- `middlewares` contains the verification files to make sure that unauthorized access to the website is avoided.
- `routes` contains all the backend routes that trigger the logic and reasoning behind everything that is done by the user in the frontend.
- Some extra files that are attached are for the configuration only and SHOULD NOT be messed with until absolutely necessary.
